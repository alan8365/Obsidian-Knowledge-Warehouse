# Webpack

## Concepts

At its core, **webpack** is a _static module bundler_ for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a [dependency graph](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/dependency-graph/) which maps every module your project needs and generates one or more _bundles_.
