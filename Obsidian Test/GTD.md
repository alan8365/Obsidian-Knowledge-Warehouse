# Capture
> my capture is microsoft todo.
- Stop store information in your brain.
- Anything crosses your mind must be caputred and store in the inbox.

## Initial mind sweep
> I don't get that.

# Clarify
Trasform the chaotic clutter of everything you've captured into concrete action steps.
- If the item will take less than 2 minutes, **do it right now**.
- If the task need more than one step, move it tow a project.

Make your task as specific and actionable as possible. Like "Call mom" to be entered as "Call Mom to discuss birthday dinner".
